# Process Visualization Tool  

> Description  
This project simulates the execution of processes in a system, displaying the execution timeline and total execution time.  

> Features  
- Takes user input for the number of processes and their execution times.  
- Ensures execution times are positive.  
- Displays a timeline of process execution.  
- Calculates the total execution time.  

> How to Run  
1. Compile the code using g++:  
2. Run the executable:


> Example Output
Enter the number of processes: 3
Enter execution time for process p1: 5
Enter execution time for process p2: 3
Enter execution time for process p3: 2

Process Execution Timeline:
p1 executed for 5 units of time.
p2 executed for 3 units of time.
p3 executed for 2 units of time.

Execution completed in 10 units of time.
